# Background
In this modern world, users expect almost every service in online. Fitness assistance is one among them. Considering the huge demand and business scope, many mobile and web applications were developed. All these existing systems are just informative, that is, they just give information about exercises, but do not track whether user is really performing them or not. This results in poor outcomes

# What we did?
We developed a web application, which not only gives information about various exercises but also track user movements to identify whether is really performing exercise or not using pose detection modules. This feature enforces users to perform exercise for real, yielding best results from exercise

# Features
- Robust authentication mechanism with session management
- Gate keepers to prevent unauthorized access
- Support for 3 exercises with an animated video, guiding users how to perform exercise
- User friendly Interface
- Body Mass Index calculator
- Chatbot to clarify queries
